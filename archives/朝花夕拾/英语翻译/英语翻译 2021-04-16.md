How can Britain's train operators possibly justify yet another increase to rail passenger fares? It has become a grimly reliable annual ritual: every January the cost of travelling by train rises, imposing a significant extra burden on those who have no option but to use the rail network to get to work or otherwise. This year's rise an average of 2.7 percent, may be a fraction lower than last year’s, but it is still well above the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation.

英国的火车运营商如何才能证明给铁路乘客再次涨价是合理的？它已成为一种非常可靠的年度仪式：每年一月，铁路旅行费用都会加，这给那些别无选择，只能利用铁路网络来工作或有其他用途的人来说增加了沉重的负担。今年的平均增长 2.7%，可能比去年降低了百分之几，但是仍然高于官方消费价格指数衡量的通货膨胀率。

Successive governments have permitted such increases on the grounds that the cost of investing in and running the rail network should be borne by those who use it, rather than the general taxpayer. Why, the argument goes, should a car-driving pensioner from Lincoln-shire have to subsidise the daily commute of a stockbroker from Surrey? Equally, there is a sense that the travails of commuters in the South East, many of whom will face among the biggest rises, have received too much attention compared to those who must endure the relatively poor infrastructure of the Midlands and the North.

历届政府都允许这种增长，理由是投资和运行铁路网络的成本应该由使用铁路网络的人而不是普通的纳税人来承担。为什么？这就是争议所在，林肯郡的驾车养老金领取者是否必须补贴萨里郡股票经纪人的日常通勤？同样，从某种意义上说，与那些必须忍受中部和北部相对较差的基础设施的人相比，那些东南部的辛苦的通勤者，大多数需要面临最大的涨幅，而因此带来的麻烦的到了太多的关注。

However, over the past 12 months, those commuters have also experienced some of the worst rail strikes in years. It is all very well train operators trumpeting the improvements they are making to the network, but passengers should be able to expect a basic level of service for the substantial sums they are now paying to travel. The responsibility for the test wave of strikes rests on the wines. However, there is a strong case that those who have been worst affected by industrial action should receive compensation for the disruption they have suffered.

然而，过去的12个月中，这些通勤者依然体验到了近年来最严重的罢工，铁路运营商鼓吹他们对铁路网络所作的改进，但是旅客应该可以期望他们现在为旅行支付的大量费用能够提供基础水平的服务，最新一波罢工的责任在于工会，但是，一个强有力的案例表明受工业行动影响最严重的人应该为其遭受破坏获得赔偿。

The Government has pledged to change the law to introduce a minimum service requirement, so that even when strikes occur services can continue to operate. This should from part of a wider package of measures to address the long-running problems on Britain's railways. Yes, more investment is needed ,but passengers will not be willing to pay more indefinitely if they must also endure cramped, unreliable services interrupted by regular chaos when time tables are changed, or planned maintenance is managed incompetently. They threat of nationalization may have been seen off for now, but it will return with a vengeance if the justified anger of passengers is not addressed in short order.

政府保证了修改法律，以规定最低服务需求，以便即使发生罢工，服务也可以继续运行。这应该是解决英国铁路中长期存在的问题的一系列更广泛措施的一部分。是，需要更多的投资，但如果乘客还必须忍受时间紧迫，时间表变更或管理计划不足而又局促的局促，不可靠的服务，他们将不愿意无限期的支付更多的费用。他们的国有化威胁可能暂时已经消失了，但是如果不及时解决乘客的正当愤怒，将以复仇的方式复出。
